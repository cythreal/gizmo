# gizmo
My collection of daily gadgets for spectroscopy related work
They are short python scripts and gnuplot scripts

You may download the gizmo as a whole package, or select individual scripts.
However, python files named libXXX.py are custom libraries shared
by all python scripts. They need to be always included in your download list.

Thank you for visiting and have fun.
